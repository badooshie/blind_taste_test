# blind_taste_test
A blind test for finding out which food/drink you like the best.

# rough ideas
user must not know what they are trying. this will mainly be for canned or bottled drinks at the moment.  may expand into food later.  drinks must be randomized. a problem of this may be that the leader may know the items if the leader is the one labeling.  can this be worked around? 

someone at first has to see the drinks to label. first idea is to use a random number assigned to each drink and write on bottom of can/bottle.

drinks should be poured in similar glasses so the shape of the glass does not alter the smell or taste

rounds will be with 3 cans at a time
rating will be 1-5, you must choose one and can't choose the same number in each round
1 = worst of the round
3 = middle
5 = best of the round
scores can be used to run an analyzsis
maybe have each score come with a notes section.

the rounds will be bracketed
so if 9 drinks total, 3 rounds in the first bracket with 3 drinks, 3 drinks move on out of the 9, leaving 3 in a final bracket

main program will ask how many people playing, how many drinks, then give each person a chance to taste and input thier score
